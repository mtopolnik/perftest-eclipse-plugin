# RequestAge
### Eclipse plug-in to stress-test HTTP services

If you are a programmer and want to leverage your skills to do some stress testing, you may like *RequestAge*. 
These are the main features:

- stress testing scripts written in JavaScript;
- interactive: apply "throttle" and see how the server keeps up on live histograms;
- minimalist, yet information-packed GUI;
- geared towards developing intuition about the tested system through rich interaction and visualisation.
